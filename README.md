# Fix-my-code-0

## Background Context
Fix my code is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and **fix it!**

Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.

The repository [0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge]() is used as initial files for all solutions.

You should not recode everything, just **fix it!**
